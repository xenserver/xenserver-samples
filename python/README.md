## How to run the scripts

Each script requires 3 command line arguments:

```
URL       : a URL of the form https://host[:port] pointing at the server
username  : a valid user on the server (e.g. root)
password  : the user's password
```

For example:

```
./install.py https://myhost.mydomain.com root letmein
```
