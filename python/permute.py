# This example takes a set of running VMs, finds the hosts on which the VMs are
# running, permutes the list of hosts and then simultaneously migrates each VM
# to the chosen new host. The program waits for all parallel migration tasks to
# complete before continuing.
#
# NB This script requires a fourth argument: an integer number of iterations.
