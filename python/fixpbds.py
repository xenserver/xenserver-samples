# This example demonstrates how to alter the device config parameters of PBD
# objects, for example, in the case the storage server configuration has changed.
#
# This is somewhat more convoluted than simple parameter changes, as PBDs
# are read-only. This is to ensure they are always consistent with the 
# state of the world.
# The parameters to change are defined in the variable 'mapping'
