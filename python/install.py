# The example chooses a Debian template at random and installs a VM from it,
# placing the disks on the Pool's default SR. Adds a VIF to the guest connecting
# it to a network on the host and boots the VM. The script waits until the guest
# agent has reported both the OS version and eth0's IP address by monitoring the
# guest metrics.
